We identify five distinctive peaks of star formation in the last 3.5 Gyr, at ~3, ~2, ~1.1, ~0.45 Gyr ago, and one presently. We compare these to the SFH of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), finding unequivocal synchronicity, with both galaxies displaying similar periods of enhanced star formation over the past ~3.5 Gyr. The parallelism between their SFHs indicates that tidal interactions between the MCs have recurrently played an important role in their evolution for at least the last ~3.5 Gyr, tidally truncating the SMC and shaping the LMC's spiral arm. We show, for the first time, an SMC-LMC correlated SFH at recent times in which enhancements of star formation are localized in the northern spiral arm of the LMC, and globally across the SMC. These novel findings should be used to constrain not only the orbital history of the MCs but also how star formation should be treated in simulations.","tags":["Star Formation History"],"title":"The synchronized dance of the magellanic clouds' star formation history","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"During my 2 month stay at the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands, I developed a pipeline to automatically search for and measure low surface brightness galaxies in the Stripe82 SDSS survey images.\n","date":1651017600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651017600,"objectID":"d8f30f8fb7681bd6ea725bd127b6ced9","permalink":"https://joannasakowska.github.io/project/lsbg/","publishdate":"2022-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/lsbg/","section":"project","summary":"During my 2 month stay at the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands, I developed a pipeline to automatically search for and measure low surface brightness galaxies in the Stripe82 SDSS survey images.","tags":["LSBGs"],"title":"Automatised search for low surface brightness galaxies","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am leading an automatised search for stellar overdensities within the DELVE-MC catalogue, which covers the entire Magellanic Clouds and their peripheries.
